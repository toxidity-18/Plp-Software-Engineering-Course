# BUILDING YOUR FIRST PRODUCT .

- MVP : Minimum Viable Product is the simplest version of your product which still provide value to your user .
- Why is it a game changer :

  - focus on core feature rather than building the whole product all at once .Thus avoid wasted resources .
  - marketing and creating product awareness becomes easier the faster the launch the sooner you get to know the real users of your app out there .
  - insights from early users help you to improve or change .
  - time and money is managed , quick launch and early user feedback .


## Build fast :

### Agile development :
1) This allows you to be flexible , quick and efficient due to the advantage of being able to adopt from user feedback .

### Steps to create your mvp .
1) Define the problem (Core Idea) you solution solves and how it solves it .E.g Meal delivery system . Keep it simple and focused .
2) Feature of you solution : this is what you solution uses to be able to solve those problem . E.g Feature can include : order system , menu option , payment processes .
3) Using No code tools (optional) Eg Bubble web-flow glide .
4) Have a prototype which has the must have feature it does not need to be perfect just . . . working to show that ur solution adds value .

### Test your MVP :
1) Launch it : to specific target audience .
2) Monitor ur solution : how user work with it and what they like what they hate and what they do not understand .
3) Gather real time feedback : this is through interviews and survey : eg : what you like , what you find confusing and what could be added to make it more better .

### Stay on track :
1) Through of product management toolkit : notion , trello , google drive etc .
2) Feedback from user : thus allows continuous improvement .
