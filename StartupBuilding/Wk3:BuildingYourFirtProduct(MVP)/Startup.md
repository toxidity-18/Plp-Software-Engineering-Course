# BUILDING YOUR FIRST PRODUCT .

- MVP : Minimum Viable Product is the simplest version of your product which still provide value to your user .
- Why is it a game changer :

  - focus on core feature rather than building the whole product all at once .Thus avoid wasted resources .
  - marketing and creating product awareness becomes easier the faster the launch the sooner you get to know the real users of your app out there .
  - insights from early users help you to improve or change .
  - time and money is managed , quick launch and early user feedback .


## Build fast :
