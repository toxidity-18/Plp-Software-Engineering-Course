# Mathematical thinking 

## [Computational thinking](https://youtu.be/qbnTZCj0ugI)
- This is a systematic way of approaching and solving complex problems 
- Create and describe a solution towards a certain problem .
- Formulate a problem thus express a solution 
### Techniques used , 
1) Functional decomposition : using structural diagrams thus breaking it down into simple approaches that is task by task .
2) Pattern recognition and generalization : Define a solution and how you can use on to other problems . Identify common trends and pattern 
3) Abstraction : simplify  the problem and focus on what matters only .
4) Algorithm : designing a set of steps to follow to follow a problem .
      - In programming and coding we will use flowcharts .Thus help think through processes and the decision a program has to make .
5) Logical reasoning goes hand in hand with algorithms .
6) Evaluation : Finalize and get to know how you can make the solution more simple and yet efficient .
