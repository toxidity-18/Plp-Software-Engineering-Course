<!-- # Mathematical thinking 

## [Computational thinking](https://youtu.be/qbnTZCj0ugI)
- This is a systematic way of approaching and solving complex problems 
- Create and describe a solution towards a certain problem .
- Formulate a problem thus express a solution 
### Techniques used , 
1) Functional decomposition : using structural diagrams thus breaking it down into simple approaches that is task by task .
2) Pattern recognition and generalization : Define a solution and how you can use on to other problems . Identify common trends and pattern 
3) Abstraction : simplify  the problem and focus on what matters only .
4) Algorithm : designing a set of steps to follow to follow a problem .
      - In programming and coding we will use flowcharts .Thus help think through processes and the decision a program has to make .
5) Logical reasoning goes hand in hand with algorithms .
6) Evaluation : Finalize and get to know how you can make the solution more simple and yet efficient .

## Introduction of mathematical thinking to coding .
- Using logical reasoning to design efficient algorithms , optimize code and debug problems .
- Why it matters :
   
   1) Enhance your ability to decompose complex problems 
   2) Analytic efficiency thus deal with trade off implementation .

#  Mathematical thinking .
- The mode of reasoning when it comes to problem solving .
- Mainly involves abstracting idea from problems thus coming up with solutions .
- Thus this means using logical reasoning to design efficient algorithms , optimize code and debug problems .
- Thus one has the ability to decompose complex problems , determine the efficiency of an algorithm through induction and contradiction .
- Trade-offs during implementation 

## Fundamentals concept of mathematical thinking .
1) Logical reasoning and proof technique 
 
 - ' Breaking big problem into smalls one , think clearly and logically and proving that ur solutions works 
 - Logic is foundation of coding we use it in if, else, amd while statements 
 - Propositional : if a user if logged in : and has paid for the services he/she get premium content .
 - Predicate : for all user with paid subscription allow download content .

- Proof technique :
- Direct proof : step by step reasoning .
- Contradiction : think the opposite 
- Induction : ???
