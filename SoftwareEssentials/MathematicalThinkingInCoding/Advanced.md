# 🧠 Mastering Advanced Mathematical Thinking in Coding

**For Practical Coding, Projects, and Real-World Use**

---

## 🔹 Part 1: What Is Advanced Mathematical Thinking?

It’s not just about numbers — it’s about how to **analyze, model, and solve** problems like a mathematician but through code.

It includes:

1. **Computational Geometry** – dealing with shapes, points, positions, distances, etc.
2. **Formal Logic & Prolog** – using logic rules to represent knowledge and infer answers.
3. **Branch and Bound Algorithm** – solving problems efficiently by skipping bad options.

## 🔹 Part 2: The Core Concepts (Simplified and Explained)

---

### ① **Computational Geometry**

➡ **Think spatially.**
Used when working with **maps, graphics, games, sensors, layout tools, or drones.**

#### Key Ideas:

* **Points:** Represented by (x, y) or (x, y, z)
* **Lines:** Line between 2 points
* **Polygons:** Shapes made from points and lines
* **Convex Hull:** The smallest convex shape around a set of points (like stretching a rubber band around them)
* **Point-in-Polygon Test:** Is a point inside a given area?

#### What You Should Focus on:

* Learn basic geometry formulas in code (distance, area, intersection)
* Visualize problems when working with spatial data
* Use libraries like:

  * JavaScript: `paper.js`, `d3-geo`
  * Python: `shapely`, `matplotlib`, `pygame`

---

### ② **Formal Logic & Prolog**

➡ **Think declaratively.**
Used when problems involve **rules, conditions, relationships, or reasoning.**

#### Key Ideas:

* **Facts**: e.g., `likes(samuel, programming).`
* **Rules**: e.g., `loves(X, Y) :- likes(X, Y), not(enemy(X, Y)).`
* **Queries**: You ask questions like: `?- loves(samuel, ai).`

This is how systems like **chatbots**, **AI planners**, or **logic-based search** work.

#### What You Should Focus on:

* Learn how to write and interpret logic rules
* Think in terms of *conditions and conclusions*
* Use it to build:

  * Expert systems
  * Chatbots
  * Rule-checking engines
  * Relationship-based filters (like dating apps, product recommenders)

💡 *Learning Prolog teaches you to “think in rules.” It makes your logic in Python, JavaScript, or SQL sharper.*

### ③ **Branch and Bound Algorithm**

➡ **Think efficiently.**
Used when solving **big optimization or decision problems** like:

* Knapsack problem
* Scheduling tasks
* Resource allocation
* Finding best route

#### Key Ideas:

* Don’t explore every path (brute force)
* Use **bounds** (limits) to cut off bad paths
* **Branch**: explore possible choices
* **Bound**: if a path can’t give better result, skip it

#### What You Should Focus on:

* Learn to spot optimization problems
* Build the habit: “Can I skip some steps?”
* Apply in games, planning, scheduling, simulations

✅ Use pseudo-code + visual tree diagrams to grasp this better.

## 🔹 Part 3: As a Coder, What Should You Always Remember?

| 💡 Concept                 | 🧠 What You Should Remember                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Computational Geometry** | Use when dealing with **shapes, positions, or maps**. Think of data like objects in space. |
| **Formal Logic / Prolog**  | Use when you have **rules or relationships**. Think in terms of “If this, then that.”      |
| **Branch & Bound**         | Use when solving **big search or decision problems**. Skip wasteful paths.                 |

## 🧭 What You Should Focus On as a Coder

| Skill                  | What to Do                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Modeling problems**  | Always break problems into logical parts. Ask: *What are the rules? What are the relationships?* |
| **Efficient thinking** | Avoid brute force. Ask: *Can I prune bad paths early?*                                           |
| **Rule-based logic**   | Learn to build condition-based systems (like Prolog) or decision trees.                          |
| **Visual reasoning**   | Draw out geometry problems or use graphs. Sketching helps code smarter.                          |
| **Reusability**        | Convert logic and geometry into reusable functions or classes.                                   |

## 📌 Final Summary

> **Mathematical thinking = seeing patterns + modeling them logically + solving them efficiently.**

As a coder:

* Don't just write loops. Think of **structure** and **logic** first.
* Ask yourself: “What are the rules? What should I skip? What shape is my data?”
* Build tools that solve **general problems** with **clear logic** and **efficient search**.
