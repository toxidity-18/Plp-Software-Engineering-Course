# Enhancing Content and Form Building .

## Html list . 
1) HTML provides 3 types of list i.e :

         A)  Ordered list : which are used when the ordered item matter thus being numbered automatically .
              - Changing the numbering style of list we use the type attribute .
         B) Unordered list : used when the ordering of items doesn't matter thus bullet are used in place of numbers 
              - Changing the numbering style of list we use the type attr (disc , square or circle) .
          C) Definition list : They pair term with their description .
          D) Nested list : nesting list within one another .

## Images .

2) src (source) : this specify the URL path for the image which relative or absolute . 
3) alt(alternative text): display text which describe what the image is about if the browser cannot load that image .
4) width and height attr help control the size of this images .
