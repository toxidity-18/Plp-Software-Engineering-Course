# Control Flow and Function in Python .

## Conditional Statements .
1) Building blocks of conditional statement are boolean variables and expression .
2) Boolean variable mean it either : true or false in python , javascript , java etc or 1,0 in SQL .
3) They help in making decision i.e If you are hungry then eat , if you are thirsty then drink , if you are tired then sleep .
4) If_statement : 

  - if .
  - if . . . else statement .
  - if  . . .elif . . . else statement .

5) Code ln 2 to 5 : the if statement evaluate the condition when it turn out to be true then the code inside the body is executed but if it evaluate to false the code inside the body is not executed .
6) Relational operators : compare values and return boolean True or False .
7) Boolean Operator in if statement : 

  - and : returns true only when condition are true .
  - or : true if at least one condition is true .
  - not : reverse true/false statements .
 - combining boolean operators with relation operators .

### If . . . else statement 
1) Code line 63 
2) The if else statement is used to execute code among 2 alternatives .
3) If the alternative is more that 3 we will use the if . . . elif . . . else statements .

### if . . . elif . . . else statements 
1) Used for multiple statements .

### Testing myself :
- Grading system .

## Python Loops :
1) Loops : repeat a block of code or perform iteration (repeating a task ) e.g iterating over a list .
2) Iterate through list , string (print out words character by character ).

### For loop :
1) Check line 98 to 108 : 

  - Using range 

    1) Series of value between 2 numeric intervals .
    2) To determine the range of value we use python built in function range() .

### While loops :
1) This performs a set of instruction as long as a give condition is true .
2) Basic structure of while loops is :

  - Initialization : set the start value .
  - Condition : set of instruction .
  - Action : what is to be perform for this loop to meet it sets of instructions .

#### Loop control : breaks and continue .
1) The break statement terminates the loop when it is meant .
2) num % 2 == 0 NB : This ask if the number is even or not .

### Nested Loops :
1) Loops can be nested inside other loops thus : help access nested list .
