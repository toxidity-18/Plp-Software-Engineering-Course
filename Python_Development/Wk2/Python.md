# Python : Built in Data Structure .

## What are data structures .
1)  Variable can store : integers , booleans or strings .
2) When handling complex data we use data structures , (why) Help organize and arrange data so that operation can be performed on them .
3) Type of data structure :

  -  Built in data structure : list , tuple , dictionary & set .
  - User defined data structure : stack , tree , queue, linked list , graph & hash map .

4) Common feature about : Built in data structure is that they are non-primitive (classed as objects) .
5) D_S can be used to solve particular problems or perfect existing solutions .

## Mutability and immutability 
1) D_S can either be mutable or immutable .

  - Mutable : changed or modified : updated , deleted eg : list .
  - Immutable : unchanged or they don't allow any modification once the data is set .
