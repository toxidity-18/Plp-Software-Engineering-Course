# Introduction 
- Python is a high level interpreted programming language used for  many different purposes .

     1) Web development .
     2) Computing 
     3) Machine learning .
     4) Hacking 

- Many different purposes thus versatile .
- Large and active community .
- Cross-platform compatible : thus runs on many different platforms .
- Plenty of libraries .

## Python variables .
- Assignment operator to assign variables to values .
- Variable is a container which store data .

```python
        # Variable as the storage area
        number = 10

        # site_name assigned to value of 'power learn project'
        site_name = 'Power learn Project'
        print(site_name)# output : Power learn Project 
        # changing the value of variables in python 
        # change the value Power learn Project to Odin Project 
        site_name = 'Odin Project'
        print(site_name)
        # assigning multiple value to multiple variables in one line 
        a.b.c = 1,5.32,'Hello'
        print (a)
        print (b)
        print (c)
        # multiple variable to the same value 
        site_1-site_2='Power learn Project'


```
## Rules of naming variable 
- There are case sensitive and also use underscores instead of camel cases .

## Data types 
- This are the types of data which can be stored inside variables .
- They include :

  1) Numeric : i.e int,floats , complex which store numeric values 
  2) String : str which contain a series of characters .
  3) Sequence : list,tuple and range which contain a collection of character .
  4) mapping:dict which holds data in key/value pairs .
  5) Boolean : bool i.e true of false 
  6) Set : they hold a series of unique names .
